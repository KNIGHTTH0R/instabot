### Goal

My goal is to write tool that finds related hashtags for one given hashtag. 
As input you give the script one hashtag.
As output you get some kind of tree structure data with may similar hashtags.
Each result hashtags should contain follow information:
	- Name of the Hashtag
	- Similarity ratio (how many times used togeter with the search hashtag)
	- Overall popularity ratio (how popular is this hashtag in general)

### Status

Experimenting with the offical instagram api
    -> Problem: Api in sandbox mode is pretty much usless
    -> Going Live: To get out of Sandbox mode, you need to submit your app for review. If your app falls into the approved use cases and gets approved, it will automatically go live. At this point any Instagram user will be able to authorize your app, but you will have access only to the permissions that you were granted during the review. If you need access to more permissions, you can submit for review again and you will not lose access to the permissions that you have already been granted.
